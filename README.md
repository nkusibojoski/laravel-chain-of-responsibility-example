# laravel-chain-of-responsibility-example
Very simple project to show how to use design pattern "Chain of responsibility".

The idea of this repo is to show exactly the implementation of "Chain of responsibility" in Laravel 5.6.

To use it, just simply clone this repo.
Then run in terminal composer-install.
Create your own .env file.
Run in terminal php artisan key:generate.
When you create connection to db, run php artisan migrate to generate tables in the given db.

Happy coding. :)
